## Discover Chicago on Two Wheels with Cyclistic! ðŸš²

Ever wonder how Chicagoans and visitors zip around the city? At Cyclistic, we were curious too! That's why we delved into a year-long exploration, diving deep into our ride data. Our mission? To understand the unique ways our riders experience the Windy City.

Guess what we found? Fascinating trends and patterns that are now steering our next big moves. Armed with these insights, we're fine-tuning our services and gearing up our marketing game to give you an even smoother ride around Chicago. Because for us, it's not just about getting from point A to B; it's about enhancing your journey every pedal of the way.

Ready to be a part of Cyclistic's exciting future in urban transportation? Hop on, and let's ride the end together!

## Marketing Analytics Team's Objectives ðŸŽ¯

The Marketing Analytics team has established a clear directive:
 
- **Goal**: Design and implement marketing strategies with a focus on converting casual riders into annual members.

To realize this ambition, the team recognizes the need for a deeper understanding of several facets:

- Distinctions between annual members and casual riders.
- Incentives that might persuade casual riders to opt for a membership.
- The influence of digital media on their marketing strategies.

In addition to the above, there's a marked interest from the Marketing Analytics team in dissecting Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to pinpoint pivotal trends.


## My Hypothesis

While the primary focus remains on converting casual riders into annual members, considering the significant presence of casual riders, I suggest a dual-strategy approach. Not only should we direct efforts towards conversion, but we must also amplify our engagement strategies targeting the casual rider segment. By resonating with the preferences and requirements of this substantial segment, we may uncover greater opportunities and ensure elevated user satisfaction across the board.

## Data Preparation ðŸ’»

I've sourced 12 months of trip data for Cyclistic from July 2022 to June 2023. Each month's dataset resides in its own `.csv` file. This first-party data, which is directly gathered and utilized by Cyclistic, is the backbone of my analysis. For this capstone, the data is licensed from "divvybikes.com," an established bike-sharing service in Chicago. It's worth noting that all riders' personal information has been thoroughly anonymized for privacy reasons.

#### Loading .csv files
```{r}
jun23_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202306-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may23_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202305-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr23_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202304-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar23_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202303-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb23_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202302-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan23_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202301-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec22_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202212-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov22_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202211-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct22_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202210-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep22_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv")
aug22_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jul22_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/irmin/OneDrive/Desktop/Case_Study_R/202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

###### For sep22_df, the file name deviates from the usual pattern.
###### However, after inspecting the dataset, the columns are consistent with other monthly datasets.

## Data Credibility: The ROCCC Approach

- **Reliable**: The dataset is both complete and accurate, encapsulating every bike ride in Chicago during our analysis period.

- **Original**: The data has been sourced from the Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study.

- **Comprehensive**: It provides a holistic view of each ride, detailing the start/end times, station names and IDs, membership types, and more.

- **Current**: The dataset is recent, covering up to the end of June 2023.

- **Cited**: We've adhered to data licensing terms, sourcing our information under the appropriate Data License Agreement.

## Cleaning

### Checking Dataset Column Consistency

In this section, I will verify if all the datasets have the same column structure. This ensures that they're consistent and compatible for my further analysis.


```{r}
all_same_columns <- all(
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(may23_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(apr23_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(mar23_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(feb23_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(jan23_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(dec22_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(nov22_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(oct22_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(sep22_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(aug22_df)),
  identical(colnames(jun23_df), colnames(jul22_df))
)

if (all_same_columns) {
  cat("All datasets have the same columns.\n")
} else {
  cat("Not all datasets have the same columns.\n")
}
```
###All datasets have the same columns.


## Let's Dive Deep Into Cyclistic's Data ðŸš´

###Step 1: First thing's first!  Merging all our monthly data sets - from July 2022 to June 2023 - into a single dataframe.

```{r}
cyclistic_df <- rbind(jun23_df, may23_df, apr23_df, mar23_df, feb23_df, jan23_df, dec22_df, nov22_df, oct22_df, sep22_df, aug22_df, jul22_df)
```

###Step 2: Now, I'm zooming into the essential details. Let's keep our data tidy by focusing only on the columns we really need.

```{r}
trimmed_cyclistic_df <- select(cyclistic_df, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual)
```

###Step 3: Keeping things neat! I'll clone our trimmed dataframe so that we can freely manipulate without messing the original.

```{r}
cyclistic_new_df <- trimmed_cyclistic_df
```

###Step 4: Time for some calculations! Figuring out how long each ride lasted.

```{r}
cyclistic_new_df$ride_length <- difftime(cyclistic_new_df$ended_at, cyclistic_new_df$started_at, units = "mins")
cyclistic_new_df$ride_length <- round(cyclistic_new_df$ride_length, digits = 1)
```

###Step 5: Knowledge is power, right? Let's enrich our dataset with some juicy time details.

```{r}
cyclistic_new_df$date <- as.Date(cyclistic_new_df$started_at) 
cyclistic_new_df$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_new_df$date),"%A") 
cyclistic_new_df$month <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_new_df$date), "%m") 
cyclistic_new_df$day <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_new_df$date), "%d") 
cyclistic_new_df$year <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_new_df$date), "%Y") 
cyclistic_new_df$time <- as_hms(cyclistic_new_df$started_at) 
cyclistic_new_df$hour <- hour(cyclistic_new_df$time) 
```

###Step 6: A sneak peek! Let's see the first few rows of our enriched data.

```{r}
head(cyclistic_new_df)
```

###Step 7: The final touch! Cleaning is essential, be it our rooms or our data. Let's dust off any inconsistencies.

```{r}
cyclistic_new_df <- na.omit(cyclistic_new_df) 
cyclistic_new_df <- distinct(cyclistic_new_df) 
cyclistic_new_df <- cyclistic_new_df[!(cyclistic_new_df$ride_length <=0),] 
```

###There you have it! With these steps, we've paved a smooth path to dive into deeper analyses and visuals. Let's roll! 

##Deep Dive: Analyzing the Ride Data
